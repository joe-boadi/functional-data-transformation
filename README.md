### Key Concept and Objective
Master essential JavaScript functions for working with strings, arrays, and objects.
 - Understand and apply functional programming principles:
- Pure functions: Always produce the same output for a given input, no side 
effects.
- Higher-order functions: Take or return functions.
- Immutability: Avoid modifying original data, and create new transformed copies.
- Practice function composition to create complex transformations from simpler ones.
